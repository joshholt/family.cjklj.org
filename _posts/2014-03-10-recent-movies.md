#####Ender's Game
We tend to enjoy a wide array of films, but Ender's game falls into one of our favorite generes.
While this movie was satisfying for the genere we didn't feel that it did a good job informing the viewer of the reality in which Ender was placed.
That reality was used as the punchline and as a way to potentially create a sequel instead of being a point of exploration.
We recommend this film just be sure that you understand Ender's reality.

#####Free Birds
With three children, kids movies have become a staple in our film catalog.
Free Birds was fun and enjoyable for the entire family, which was a nice surprise.
Filled with our favorite type of comedy (sarcasm), Free Birds was a non stop laugh riot.
We recommend this film for the whole family.

#####Hunger Games (Catching Fire)
Staying true to the realism of a harsh environment filled with mind games and fear based manipulation, Hunger Games (Catching Fire) was as good or better
than the first installment in this film franchise. From start to finish we were engaged in the story and we were left waiting for the next installment as
was the intention of the film creators. We recommend this film with out reservation, but do watch this one after you put the kids to bed.

#####Thor: The Dark World
For our second installment in the Thor series we meet a more humble Thor, a trapped Loki, and Jane Foster is rebuilding her life.
Our obsession with comic book films has seen it's ups and downs but Thor: The Dark World was a pleasant surprise. Filled with Action
and a decent story line that brings in some elements from the previous Thor and Avengers.
We recommend this film, but do watch after you have put the little ones to bed and it does have some foul language.

#####Mr. Peabody and Sherman
We were drawn to Mr. Peabody and Sherman because of our children and memories from our own childhood. The intellectual bits were there but the film failed
to grab you attention early on (which we feel is a requirement of a child film). While the movie did please in the end it took a while to get to the good parts.
We recommend this film but if you can wait until it's available at Red Box or Netflix.

######Frozen
Our children are always fond of musical ballad animations with a decent moral compass, and that's exactly what Frozen is.
All in all this is a film that you can watch over and over without being annoyed. Well unless the fact that the singers
can't actually sing annoys you. That being said, this is a good wholesome family film and we recommend it for a nice family
evening. Just don't go to youtube and listen to the live versions of the songs b/c they will make you cringe with raw notes.

#####Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters
It just so happens that our oldest was learning about mythology when we picked this movie up from Red Box. The second installment in the Percy Jackson
feels like it lives in the same realm as the first. The story in the second installment is much better than the first as it give you some history
around camp half blood. If you liked the first installment in this series then you will most likely enjoy "The Sea of Monsters" as well.
This film was enjoyed as a family and we felt that it was ok for the kids. We recommend this film.

#####Safe Haven
We were drawn to Safe Haven because it takes place in a North Carolina costal town. Holding true to a genre that we watch on occasion after putting the kids to bed,
this film will pull at your heart strings. It will make you run through a wide array of emotions. In the end Safe Haven was a soul satisfying film that will make for
a good relaxing evening with your spouse or significant other.
We recommend this film, just make sure that little ones aren't sitting there watching with you.

#####Despicable Me 2
This fun family film will have you hooked from the start through the grand finally. Our children have enjoyed this film so much that they watch it nearly everyday.
From an adult's perspective, there's enough adult humor and dialog here that it's enjoyable and we felt that it was much better than the first film in the series.
We recommend this film for the entire family.
